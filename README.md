# 3-equation-system-solver-comparison

This repository features the differences between two 3-equation system solvers made in Python - one is made without Numpy, the other, fully made with this library. Both programs consist in parsing the equations into a matrix and a vector and using them to resolve the system.

note: the codes have comments written in Romanian.
